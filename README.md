# intro-to-java-unit-tests
A practice for students who write unit tests for the first time.

The purpuse of this project is to teach students to write unit tests and debug.
This project includes a small example of a shopping cart in a shopping website.

Follow the following steps to get the basics of unit testing using Junit:
1. Write the unit tests missing
2. Run the tests
3. Find bugs (if there are any)
4. Fix the bugs

and.. You're done!
